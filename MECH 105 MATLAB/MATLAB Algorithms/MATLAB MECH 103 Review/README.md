# MECH 103 Review
This is a colection of the review codes from my MECH 103 class for my MECH 105 class.
## Review 1
this algorithm creates two plots. the first being charge vs. time with a given capacitance, and the second being charge vs, time with the given capacitance multiplied by ten.
## Review 2
this algorithm creates a plot of experimental data vs. expected data over seventy minutes with a new point every thirty seconds. 
## Review 3
this algorithm is used to calculate the volume of water in a tank of spectal dimentions.
## Review 4 (special matrix)
This function should return a matrix A as described in the problem statement

* The value of each element in the first row is the number of the column.

* The value of each element in the first column is the number of the row.

* The rest of the elements each has a value equal to the sum of the element above it and element to the left.

* The function must return a sensible error if the user does not input exactly two arguments

* The function should be well commented

Inputs:

n is the number of rows

m the number of columns

Outputs:

A is the product matrix

It is recomended to first create the matrxix A of the correct size, filling it with zeros to start with is not a bad choice
