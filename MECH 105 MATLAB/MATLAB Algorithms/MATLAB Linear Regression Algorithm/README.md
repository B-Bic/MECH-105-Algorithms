# Linear Regression Algorithm
linearRegression Computes the linear regression of a data set based on inputs provided
## inputs:
x: x-values for our data set

y: y-values for our data set

## Outputs:
fX: x-values with outliers removed

fY: y-values with outliers removed

slope: slope from the linear regression y=mx+b

intercept: intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b

Rsquared: R^2, a.k.a. coefficient of determination
## Example of call code 
[fX, fY, slope, intercept, Rsquared] = linearRegression(x,y)
